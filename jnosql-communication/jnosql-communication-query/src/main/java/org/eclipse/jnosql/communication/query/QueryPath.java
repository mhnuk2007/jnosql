/**
 * Represents a state field path expression used as an operand in a query condition.
 * <p>
 * A {@code QueryPath} does <strong>not</strong> represent a literal value. Instead,
 * it refers to a field or attribute of the query source and is typically used when
 * comparing one field against another.
 *
 * <p>Examples:</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * numBitsRequired = floorOfSquareRoot
 * order.total > order.discount
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Path expressions are resolved against the query model and evaluated at runtime.
 * They must not be quoted, bound as parameters, or treated as constant values.
