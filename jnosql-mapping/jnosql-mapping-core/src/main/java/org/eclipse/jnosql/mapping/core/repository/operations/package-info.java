/**
 * Provides the default core implementations for the semantic repository
 * operations defined by the Jakarta Data integration layer. Each class in
 * this package implements a specific repository operation, such as
 * {@code findBy}, {@code findAll}, {@code countBy}, annotated queries, or
 * cursor-based pagination.
 *
 * <p>
 * These implementations serve as the baseline execution engine used by the
 * repository proxy. Storage providers or specialized engines may override
 * any of these components using CDI alternatives. Operations that are not
 * supported by the core engine provide implementations that consistently
 * throw {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * </p>
