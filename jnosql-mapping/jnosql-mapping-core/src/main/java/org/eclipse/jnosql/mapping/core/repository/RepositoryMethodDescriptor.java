/**
 * Describes a repository method by combining its resolved
 * {@link RepositoryMethodType} with the corresponding
 * {@link RepositoryMethod} metadata when available.
 * This descriptor is the outcome of method analysis performed during
 * repository initialization. It classifies a Java {@code Method} into
 * one of the supported semantic types and, when applicable, provides
 * the parsed metadata used for query execution. Methods such as those
 * inherited from {@code Object} may not expose metadata but still
 * require classification, and this descriptor represents both cases.
 *
 * @param type   the resolved semantic type of the repository method
 * @param method the parsed repository method metadata, or {@code null}
 *               when the method does not provide Jakarta Data metadata
