/**
 * A {@link LongSupplier} implementation that lazily computes a {@code long}
 * value once and caches the result for subsequent accesses.
 *
 * <p>The wrapped supplier is only invoked during the first call to
 * {@link #getAsLong()}. After the value is computed, the cached value is
 * returned for all future invocations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is thread-safe and guarantees that the delegate
 * supplier is executed at most once. A runtime exception or error is cached
 * and rethrown on subsequent accesses.</p>
 *
 * <p>This utility is useful for expensive operations such as database
 * aggregation queries, count operations, or remote service calls that should
 * be deferred until explicitly needed.</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * LongSupplier supplier = new LazyLongSupplier(
 *         () -> repository.count()
 * );
 *
 * // Count query executes here
 * long total = supplier.getAsLong();
 *
 * // Cached value reused
 * long cached = supplier.getAsLong();
 * }</pre>
