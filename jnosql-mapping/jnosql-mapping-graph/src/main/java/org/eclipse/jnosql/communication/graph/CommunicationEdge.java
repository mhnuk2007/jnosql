/**
 * Represents an Edge (relationship) in a NoSQL database communication layer.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a standardized representation of an edge, similar to how
 * {@link CommunicationEntity} represents a vertex in the NoSQL database context.
 * It serves as an abstraction for graph-based databases that support relationships between entities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should ensure proper mapping of edges, allowing seamless
 * communication between different graph database backends, such as Neo4j and Apache TinkerPop.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * CommunicationEdge edge = ...;
 * Object edgeId = edge.id();
 * CommunicationEntity source = edge.source();
 * CommunicationEntity target = edge.target();
 * String relationship = edge.label();
 * Map<String, Object> properties = edge.properties();
 * }</pre>
