/**
 * A specialization of {@link DatabaseManager} for handling graph database operations.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a common abstraction for graph-based NoSQL databases, supporting
 * operations related to creating, retrieving, and deleting relationships (edges) between entities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should provide database-specific handling for creating edges,
 * retrieving relationships by ID, and removing them, ensuring consistency across different graph database providers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Graph Database Terminology:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Edge:</b> Represents a relationship between two entities (vertices).</li>
 *     <li><b>Source:</b> The starting entity of a relationship (TinkerPop: <i>out</i>, Neo4j: first node).</li>
 *     <li><b>Target:</b> The ending entity of a relationship (TinkerPop: <i>in</i>, Neo4j: second node).</li>
 *     <li><b>Label:</b> Describes the type of relationship (e.g., "FRIENDS_WITH", "WORKS_AT").</li>
 *     <li><b>Properties:</b> Key-value metadata associated with an edge.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * GraphDatabaseManager manager = ...;
 * CommunicationEntity person = new CommunicationEntity("Person", Map.of("name", "John"));
 * CommunicationEntity book = new CommunicationEntity("Book", Map.of("title", "DDD in Action"));
 *
 * // Create an edge
 * manager.edge(person, "READS", book, Map.of("since", 2020));
 *
 * // Find an edge by ID
 * Optional<Edge<Person, Book>> edge = manager.findEdgeById(123L);
 *
 * // Remove an edge
 * manager.remove(person, "READS", book);
 *
 * // Delete an edge by ID
 * manager.deleteEdge(123L);
 * }</pre>
