/**
 * Provides the execution engine for repository methods in semi-structured
 * databases. This package resolves repository operations based on method
 * patterns such as "findBy", "deleteBy", "countBy", and "existsBy",
 * and on annotations including {@link jakarta.data.repository.Query},
 * {@link jakarta.data.repository.Insert}, {@link jakarta.data.repository.Update},
 * {@link jakarta.data.repository.Delete}, {@link jakarta.data.repository.Save},
 * and {@link jakarta.data.repository.Find}.
 * The types in this package replace the deprecated execution logic previously
 * located in {@code org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.semistructured.query}. New
 * applications should rely on this package as the standard repository execution
 * layer for Jakarta NoSQL.
 *
 * @since 1.2
