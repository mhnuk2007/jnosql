/**
 * This package is deprecated and preserved only for backward compatibility.
 * It contains the previous query execution infrastructure for semi-structured
 * databases, including legacy components used before Jakarta Data integration.
 * The new execution model is now provided in
 * {@code org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.semistructured.repository}, which offers a
 * clearer and more consistent API aligned with Jakarta Data. Applications and
 * extensions should migrate to
 * {@link org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.semistructured.repository}, as this legacy
 * structure will not receive new features.
