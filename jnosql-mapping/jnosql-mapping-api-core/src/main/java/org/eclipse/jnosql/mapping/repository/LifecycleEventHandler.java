/**
 * Handles Jakarta Data entity lifecycle events triggered by Eclipse JNoSQL
 * repository operations.
 * <p>
 * A lifecycle event handler is invoked before or after an entity is processed
 * by a corresponding datastore operation. Implementations may use these
 * callbacks to integrate Eclipse JNoSQL with event mechanisms such as CDI,
 * auditing, metrics, logging, or application-specific infrastructure.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The expected invocation order is:</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * lifecycleEventHandler.preInsert(entity);
 * datastore.insert(entity);
 * lifecycleEventHandler.postInsert(entity);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Pre-operation callbacks are invoked immediately before the datastore
 * operation. Post-operation callbacks are invoked only after the corresponding
 * datastore operation completes successfully.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations should execute callbacks synchronously when propagating
 * Jakarta Data lifecycle events. The entity instance supplied to these methods
 * might be mutable and is not guaranteed to be safe for concurrent access.
 * Implementations that perform asynchronous work should create an appropriate
 * immutable representation of the entity before transferring data to another
 * thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Applications may provide an alternative implementation to customize how
 * lifecycle events are propagated. Implementations are encouraged to avoid
 * modifying the supplied entity because mutation during lifecycle notification
 * can result in undefined or datastore-specific behavior.
 * </p>
