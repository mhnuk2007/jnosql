/**
 * This interface defines a converter that converts a {@link Class} to an {@link EntityMetadata}.
 * It is used to map Java classes representing entities to their corresponding metadata,
 * which includes information such as their structure, annotations, and relationships.
 *
 * <p>The {@link ClassConverter} extends the {@link Function} interface, allowing you to use it as
 * a function that takes a {@link Class} input and returns an {@link EntityMetadata} output.
 * This conversion is essential for managing and manipulating entities within the context of
 * data storage and persistence frameworks.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface should provide logic to extract relevant information
 * from the provided {@link Class} instance and create a corresponding {@link EntityMetadata}.
 * This metadata can be used by data mapping and storage components to facilitate various
 * operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and schema management.
